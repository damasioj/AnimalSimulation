# Master's Thesis: Animal Simulation

This project is being developed for a Master's thesis that studies the implementation of behaviours in subjects using Machine Learning. The AnimalSimulation project simulates the behaviours of different animals in a variety of environments. 

# Unity ML-Agents SDK

The project uses Unity ML-Agents to train agents. It includes the example environments but these are only used for reference purposes.

# Goals

The following goals of this project is to simulate an animal:

- [x] reaching a point in space
- [x] reaching and consuming an object
- [ ] reaching and consuming multiple objects while avoiding bad ones
- [ ] reaching and consuming multiple objects while avoiding danger
